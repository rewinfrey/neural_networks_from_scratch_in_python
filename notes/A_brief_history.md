### Orientation

Machine learning takes input and produces a desired output for tasks like classification and regression.

There are two main types of machine learning:  supervised and unsupervised.

Supervised machine learning:  uses labeled data for training.
Unsupervised machine learning:  finding structure in data without labels.

The datum for data is the feature.  Groups of features are feature sets.  Usually feature sets are represeted as vectors or arrays.

Classification or labels of data determine its category or role in the structure of the data.

Neural networks were first conceived in the 1940's.

Training didn't succeed until the 1960's with the introduction of the concept of backpropagation.

But neural networks haven't received much attention until the 2010's based on wining comptetions.
